-- 1. How many patients have been admitted or readmitted over time?

-- Explanation
--Step 1: Sort Encounters by Patient and Date
--The LAG() function retrieves the previous encounter's Start (admission date) for the same Patient.

--Step 2: Calculate Days Between Encounters
--Use DATEDIFF() to calculate the difference in days between the current and previous admission.

--Step 3: Filter for Readmissions
--Filter rows where DaysBetween is â‰¤ 30 (or any threshold for readmission).

--Step 4: Aggregate Results
--Count the number of readmissions for each patient.

--Take the average of all calculated lengths of stay.
